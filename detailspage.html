            The botanical name for the tea plant is camellia sinensis. 
            This plant originated in southern China thousands of years ago, 
            and has been cultivated and consumed for hundreds of years. 
            Camellia sinensis has two main varietals: camellia sinensis var. 
            sinensis, which grows primarily in China and other East Asian countries 
            and has a milder, mellower character, and camellia sinensis var. 
            assamica, which grows primarily in India and is generally heartier 
            and more robust.

            Black tea, green tea, white tea, oolong tea, pu-erh tea, 
            and purple tea are all made from the camellia sinensis tea plant. 
            Each of these teas develops its unique characteristics through different 
            harvesting and processing methods. Some teas are steamed, some are pan-fired. 
            Some are allowed to oxidize and some arent. 
            Some tea leaves are hand-formed into tightly rolled balls, 
            while other tea leaves are roughly chopped, or left to air-dry 
            in their natural shape. Some teas are harvested in the 
            first weeks of the spring season, while others are harvested in the summer and fall.

            There are so many different factors that influence the appearance and flavor of tea,
            and specific tea processing methods have been developed over hundreds of years. 
            Today, there are six main categories of tea, 
            each with different signature characteristics and processing methods.</p>

            <p><em>Tea has been cultivated and consumed for hundreds of years.</em> Archeological research
                even indicates that tea may have been drunk over two thousand years ago! 
                Originating in southwest China and northeast India, camellia sinensis 
                has a rich history and cultural significance in many countries all over the globe.
                Today, tea is mainly grown in places like China, India, Japan, Nepal, and Vietnam, 
                as well as several other south and east Asian countries. With proper cultivation 
                methods, however, tea can be grown in a wide variety of locales, from Kenya to 
                Hawaii and many places in between.
                While all true teas are produced from camellia sinensis, the ways in which teas 
                are processed result in many different varieties of tea, such as black, green, 
                white, oolong, purple, and pu-erh. Some factors that go into producing different 
                kinds of tea include oxidation level and processing techniques such as steaming, 
                firing, rolling, and aging. Other circumstances that contribute to different 
                varieties of tea include the use of specific cultivars and the terroir in 
                which tea is grown.</p>

            <p><em>All tea made from camellia sinensis contains some amount of caffeine, 
                making it a popular choice for a warming, uplifting morning drink.</em>
                While black and pu-erh teas contain the highest amount of caffeine, 
                other varieties such as white and purple teas contain relatively low amounts. 
                Tea is also extremely high in antioxidants, and is rich with numerous 
                other health benefits.
                In addition to these positive effects, the act of brewing up a cup can be a 
                soothing and meditative process. No matter what kind of tea you prefer, 
                tea can be a great way to take a pause in a busy day and enjoy a 
                delicious cup with a rich history!</p>
